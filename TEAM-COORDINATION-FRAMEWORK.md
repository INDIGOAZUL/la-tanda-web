## üîÑ DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

### Decision Types

**Type 1: Reversible Decisions (Fast)**
- Made by individual contributor or small team
- Examples: Code implementation approach, design mockup style, tweet wording
- **Process:** Just do it, get feedback later
- **Philosophy:** Bias toward action

**Type 2: Consequential But Reversible (Moderate)**
- Require team discussion but can be changed
- Examples: Feature prioritization, tech stack additions, marketing campaign theme
- **Process:**
  1. Propose in Discord or GitHub Discussion
  2. Gather feedback for 2-3 days
  3. Founder makes final call
  4. Document decision

**Type 3: One-Way Doors (Slow)**
- Very hard to reverse
- Examples: Blockchain migration, major rebrand, legal agreements, token economics changes
- **Process:**
  1. RFC (Request for Comments) document created
  2. Shared with full team for 1 week
  3. Discussion in monthly meeting
  4. Founder decision (with transparency on reasoning)
  5. Full documentation
