## 📰 HACKER NEWS POST

**Title:**
```
Show HN: La Tanda – Open source DeFi platform, earn crypto for contributing
```

**Body:**
```
Hey HN! We built La Tanda, a Web3 platform for rotating savings groups (like Mexican tandas), and just open-sourced it with a token bounty program.

The idea: traditional "tandas" (cooperative savings groups common in Latin America) meet blockchain. Users form groups, contribute regularly, and each period one member gets the full pool. Smart contracts handle the vesting, governance, and rewards.

Tech stack:
- Backend: Node.js + Express (85 REST endpoints), PostgreSQL (23 tables)
- Frontend: Vanilla JS with glassmorphism UI, PWA-ready
- Blockchain: Solidity smart contracts on Polygon, Hardhat for development

We just launched 6 bounties (100-500 LTD tokens each) for contributors:
- Database backup automation
- API rate limiting
- Admin analytics dashboard
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Transaction pagination
- Mobile PWA optimization

The bounty budget is 250M LTD tokens from our development allocation, which at current distribution rate = 2,000+ years sustainability.

No gatekeeping - just pick a bounty, comment to claim, fork, implement, submit PR, get paid within 24h.

Live platform: https://latanda.online
GitHub: https://github.com/INDIGOAZUL/la-tanda-web
Bounties: https://github.com/INDIGOAZUL/la-tanda-web/blob/main/ACTIVE-BOUNTIES.md

Would love feedback on the approach (both the platform and the bounty model)!

**First Comment (Post-Launch):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Thanks for checking out La Tanda!

I'm [YOUR_NAME], and I've been working on bringing traditional rotating savings groups (tandas) to blockchain.

**What are tandas?**
Common in Latin America and Asia, tandas are cooperative savings groups where members contribute regularly and take turns receiving the pool. It's like a peer-to-peer savings circle.

**Why blockchain?**
- Transparency (all transactions on-chain)
- Smart contract automation (no coordinator needed)
- Token incentives (earn LTD for participating)
- Global access (anyone can join)

**Why open source + bounties?**
We want to build this WITH the community, not just FOR them. Contributing developers earn LTD tokens, which they'll be able to stake, use in governance, or trade once we're on mainnet.

**Try it out:**
1. Live platform: https://latanda.online
2. Contribute on GitHub: https://github.com/INDIGOAZUL/la-tanda-web
3. Earn tokens: 6 bounties live (100-500 LTD each)

Happy to answer any questions! AMA 🚀
