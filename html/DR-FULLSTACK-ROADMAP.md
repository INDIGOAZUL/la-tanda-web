## 📝 NOTES

### Lessons Learned (Week 1-2)
1. **PostgreSQL Migration:** Peer authentication required changing to TCP with password for PM2
2. **Dual-Write Complexity:** Inline pattern simpler than module restructuring for production
3. **Testing First:** Test API validation saved production downtime
4. **Backup Everything:** Multiple backup points enabled safe experimentation
5. **Incremental Approach:** One endpoint at a time prevented overwhelming changes

### Best Practices
1. **Always backup before major changes**
2. **Test in isolated environment first (test API)**
3. **Monitor logs continuously during deployment**
4. **Document everything in real-time**
5. **Celebrate small wins (each endpoint migrated is progress)**
