## 3️⃣ REDDIT FIRST POST (r/web3)

**Title:**
```
La Tanda Web3 - Bringing Traditional Rotating Savings (ROSCAs) to Blockchain
```

**Flair:** Select "Project" or "Discussion"

**Content:**

```markdown
Hey r/web3,

I'm building **La Tanda**, a DeFi protocol that brings traditional rotating savings groups (ROSCAs/tandas) to blockchain.

## What are Tandas?

Tandas (also called ROSCAs - Rotating Savings and Credit Associations) are traditional savings groups used by millions globally, especially in Latin America and developing countries. Members contribute regularly, and each receives a lump sum payout on a rotating basis.

**The problem:** They rely on trust, lack transparency, and are limited to local communities.

## The Web3 Solution

La Tanda uses smart contracts to:
- ✅ Automate contributions and payouts
- ✅ Ensure transparency (on-chain records)
- ✅ Enable global participation
- ✅ Reward participants with LTD tokens

## Current Status

- ✅ Live platform: https://latanda.online
- ✅ Open source: https://github.com/INDIGOAZUL/la-tanda-web
- ✅ Smart contracts deployed on Polygon
- ✅ Active bounty program (earn LTD tokens by contributing)
- 🔜 Full public launch (November 2025)

## Why This Matters

40% of people globally lack access to traditional banking. La Tanda brings them into DeFi with a familiar, trusted model that's been used for generations.

## Get Involved

- **Developers:** Earn LTD tokens through bounties - https://github.com/INDIGOAZUL/la-tanda-web/issues
