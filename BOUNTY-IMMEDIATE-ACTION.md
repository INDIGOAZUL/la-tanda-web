**Go directly to Algora:**
https://algora.io/bounties/typescript

**Filter strategy:**
- Click "Newest" or "Sort by date"
- Open first 20 bounties in new tabs
- For each, click "View bounty" to go to GitHub issue
- **RED FLAG CHECK:**
  - Any comments saying "I'll work on this"?
  - Any PRs linked?
  - Label shows "🙋 Bounty claim"?
  - If YES to any → Close tab, move to next
- **GREEN FLAG:**
  - No claims
  - Clear requirements
  - Good first issue or your skill match
  - **CLAIM IMMEDIATELY**

**CLAIM TEMPLATE:**
```
I'd like to work on this bounty.

**My relevant experience:**
- Built production JWT authentication system (currently live at latanda.online)
- Full-stack TypeScript/Node.js developer
- Experience with PostgreSQL, Nginx, API integration
- Previous projects: [link to La Tanda repo if public]

**Approach:**
[Briefly outline how you'll solve the issue - 2-3 bullet points]

**Timeline:** [realistic estimate, e.g., "7-10 days"]

Let me know if you need any clarification before I start!

### **STEP 3: Alternative Search (20 minutes)**

If Algora is picked clean, try these:

**GitHub Direct Search:**
```
Go to: https://github.com/search

Search: label:bounty created:>2025-10-14 is:open language:TypeScript

Filter results:
- Click on interesting issues
- Check for claims/PRs
- Claim if clean
```

**HackerOne (Different approach):**
```
Go to: https://hackerone.com/opportunities/all

- Filter by "New programs"
- Look for programs with <100 reports (less competitive)
- Find low-hanging fruit (misconfigurations, missing security headers)
- Submit quick report
- Potential: $50-500 for easy finds
```

## 🚀 BEST IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY: BUILD PASSIVE INCOME

**Why this is better than bounty hunting right now:**

1. **No competition** - You're creating value, not competing
2. **Leverages existing work** - Your auth system is production-ready
3. **Passive income** - Pays indefinitely vs one-time bounty
4. **Higher ceiling** - $500-1500/month vs $100-300 per bounty

### **ACTION PLAN (4 hours total):**

#### **Hour 1-2: Extract & Package**
```bash
cd ~/la-tanda-web

# Create new npm package directory
mkdir latanda-auth-middleware
cd latanda-auth-middleware

# Initialize npm
npm init -y

# Edit package.json:
{
  "name": "@latanda/auth-middleware",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Production-ready JWT authentication for Node.js + PostgreSQL + Nginx",
  "main": "index.js",
  "keywords": ["authentication", "jwt", "postgresql", "nginx", "sessions"],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}

# Extract files from La Tanda:
# - JWT token generation/validation code
# - Session management
# - Role-based access control (MIT, IT, USER, ADMIN)
# - PostgreSQL schema/migrations
# - Nginx config templates

# Create index.js with clean API:
module.exports = {
  createAuthMiddleware,
  verifyToken,
  generateToken,
  roleCheck,
  // ... etc
}
```

#### **Hour 3: Create Professional README**
```markdown
# @latanda/auth-middleware

Production-ready JWT authentication system for Node.js applications.

## Features
- ✅ JWT token generation & validation
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ PostgreSQL session management
- ✅ Nginx proxy integration
- ✅ Battle-tested in production (latanda.online)

## Quick Start (5 minutes to secure auth)
\`\`\`javascript
const { createAuthMiddleware } = require('@latanda/auth-middleware');

// Your API server
app.use('/api/*', createAuthMiddleware({
  jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  database: { /* PostgreSQL config */ }
}));

// That's it! Routes are now protected.
\`\`\`

## Case Study

## License
MIT
```

#### **Hour 4: Publish & Promote**
```bash
# Publish to npm
npm login
npm publish --access public

# Create GitHub repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: Production-ready JWT auth"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/latanda-auth-middleware.git
git push -u origin main

# Post on dev.to
Title: "I extracted my production auth system into an npm package"
Content:
- Problem: Authentication is hard
- Solution: Use battle-tested code
- Here's what I built for La Tanda
- Now available as @latanda/auth-middleware
- 5-minute setup
- [Include code examples]

# Post on Reddit
r/javascript: "Built a production-ready JWT auth middleware (currently powering latanda.online)"
r/node: Same post

# Tweet/X
"Just published @latanda/auth-middleware - production JWT auth for Node.js
- PostgreSQL sessions
- Role-based access
- Nginx integration

## 💰 INCOME COMPARISON

### **Bounty Hunting (Active Income):**
- **Time to first $:** 7-14 days (if you find unclaimed bounty today)
- **First income:** $100-300
- **Monthly potential:** $600-1200 (requires 20-30 hours/week)
- **Scalability:** Linear (more time = more money, but capped)
- **Competition:** HIGH (everyone hunting same bounties)

### **npm Package (Passive Income):**
- **Time to first $:** 30-90 days (building credibility)
- **First income:** $0-50 (GitHub Sponsors)
- **Month 6 potential:** $200-500
- **Month 12 potential:** $500-1500+
- **Scalability:** Exponential (more users = more sponsors/consulting)
- **Competition:** LOW (you're creating unique value)

---

## ✅ MY RECOMMENDATION

**Do BOTH, but prioritize passive:**

### **TODAY (4 hours):**
1. **Spend 30 min:** Quick scan of Algora for easy bounty
2. **Spend 3.5 hours:** Extract auth system into npm package

**Why?**
- You already have the auth system working
- 4 hours to publish = potential $500-1500/month passive
- vs 40 hours bounty hunting = $1200 one-time

### **THIS WEEK:**
- Day 1 (today): Publish npm package + post on dev.to
- Day 2: Post on Reddit, Twitter/X, Hacker News
- Day 3-7: Quick daily check of Algora (15 min/day)
- If you find unclaimed bounty: Claim and work on it
- If not: Improve npm package docs, add features

### **MONTH 1:**
- npm package gets first 100 downloads
- 0-2 GitHub Sponsors ($0-50/month)
- Maybe 1 bounty claimed ($100-300 one-time)
- **Total:** $100-350

### **MONTH 3:**
- npm package at 500+ downloads
- 2-5 GitHub Sponsors ($50-150/month)
- First consulting inquiry ($500-1000)
- **Total:** $550-1150

### **MONTH 6:**
- npm package at 2000+ downloads
- 5-10 sponsors ($150-300/month)
- 1-2 consulting clients ($1000-2000)
- **Total:** $1150-2300 (mostly passive!)
