## 📋 How to Pay Bounties (Step-by-Step)

### **Payment Scripts Created:**
I've created 2 new scripts for you:
1. **`check-ltd-balance.js`** - Check your balance anytime
2. **`pay-bounty.js`** - Pay a bounty with one command

---

### **Step 1: Get Contributor's Wallet Address**

When they submit a PR, they should include their Polygon Amoy wallet address in the PR description.

**Template for PR #11 comment:**
```
Hi @Sahillather002!

Great work on the PR! 🎉

To process your 100 LTD bounty payment, please reply with your Polygon Amoy testnet wallet address.

Format: 0x...

Once you provide it, I'll send the payment within 24 hours!
```

---

### **Step 2: Edit Payment Script**

Edit `smart-contracts/scripts/pay-bounty.js`:

```javascript
const PAYMENT_DATA = {
    recipient: "0xCONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS",  // From PR description
    amount: 100,                          // 100 LTD for issue #1
    bountyIssue: "#11",                   // PR number
    contributor: "@Sahillather002",       // Their GitHub username
    description: "Database Backup Automation"
};
```

---

### **Step 3: Execute Payment**

Run the payment script:

```bash
cd /home/ebanksnigel/la-tanda-web
npx hardhat run scripts/pay-bounty.js --network amoy
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Script validates you have enough LTD
2. ✅ Checks gas balance (you need ~0.001 MATIC for gas)
3. ✅ Sends 100 LTD to contributor
4. ✅ Returns transaction hash
5. ✅ Shows PolygonScan link

**Example output:**
```
✅ PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

   Transaction Hash: 0xabc123...
   Block Number: 12345678
   Gas Used: 65000

💵 Final Balances:
   Sender: 199999900.0 LTD
   Recipient: 100.0 LTD

✅ 100 LTD tokens sent to your wallet
📄 TX: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/0xabc123...
